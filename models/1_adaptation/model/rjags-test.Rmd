title: "Playing with RJAGS for model building"

I'd like to explore building a model using RJAGS. Depending on the complexity of the model, and the limitations of my coding/conceptual knowledge, this may not be possible, especially given the current time limit. Depending on the time limit, I might just end up adjusting one of Sebastian's models in python.

```{r}
library(rjags)
library(runjags)


```
